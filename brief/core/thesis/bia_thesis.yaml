    Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) — the sovereign wealth fund of Brunei,
    established in 1983 to manage and grow the country's general reserve fund and
    external assets. BIA operates under the Ministry of Finance and Economy of Brunei
    and invests globally across multiple asset classes including public equities,
    fixed income, real estate, private equity, and strategic venture/growth
    investments. As a sovereign wealth fund, BIA focuses on long-term capital
    preservation, global diversification, and strategic participation in large
    institutional investments rather than early-stage startup bets.

  mandate_buyer: >
    Global institutional adopters and strategic partners across North America,
    Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. BIA prioritizes large strategic stakes,
    co-investments with established partners, and long-term holdings that align
    with its mandate to preserve and grow national reserves while diversifying
    away from oil/gas dependence. Investments typically involve significant
    capital allocations in established companies, financial institutions, real
    estate assets, and selective participation in growth financings.
