    Sentinel Global — a multi‑stage venture firm backing enterprise technology
    founders reshaping the systems that underpin global markets. We bridge the
    gap between innovators and adopters and help teams ship scalable,
    defensible, adoption‑ready platforms built for mission‑critical performance,
    regulatory readiness and global deployment.

  mandate_buyer: >
    Global enterprise and institutional adopters (North America, Europe, Asia,
    and select emerging markets). Prioritize platforms/infrastructure with
    compliance‑by‑design and clear pathways to production pilots, integrations,
    and durable distribution within complex systems.

  stages_preferred:
    - Series A
    - Series B
  stages_considered:
    - Select Seed
    - Growth (case‑by‑case)

  focus_areas:
    Enterprise & AI:
      - Distributed cloud infrastructure; stream processing and real‑time analytics
      - Privacy, security, and disinformation‑risk mitigation for AI
      - Post‑quantum cryptography and fully homomorphic encryption applications
      - Enterprise agents and AI copilots for finance, operations, IT

    "The Finternet":
      - Programmable money, stablecoins and tokenized real‑world assets (RWA)
      - Agentic finance rails and workflow automation for institutions
      - Blockchain & decentralized network infrastructure (wallets, key mgmt, MPC, account abstraction)
      - Compliance & forensics (KYC/KYA, proof of personhood) and institutional adoption infra
      - Open social networks for enterprise/financial use cases

    Interoperable Commerce:
      - Supply‑chain & logistics optimization; last‑mile and routing intelligence
      - AI‑enabled factory/operations optimization and quality
      - Bot‑to‑bot transactions and secure, auditable data exchange
      - Advanced data for global operations and cross‑system interoperability

  adoption_enablement:  # Sentinel Labs & adopter bridge
    - Research‑led theses via Sentinel Labs and advisory council; insight‑driven GTM
    - Access to enterprise buyer networks for design partners and pilots
    - Readiness reviews: security, compliance, observability, SLAs, data residency
    - Playbooks for integrations (ERP, core banking, supply‑chain, identity), and co‑selling

  positive_signals:
    - Clear regulated‑industry buyer; security/compliance central to product
    - Defensibility via cryptography, proprietary data/graphs, or infrastructure lock‑in
    - Capital‑efficient GTM; credible path to > $50M ARR with mission‑critical deployments
    - Evidence of adopter traction: pilots, LOIs, signed MSAs, integration roadmaps

  negative_signals:
    - Pure consumer crypto/speculation, adtech, gaming, creator‑only focus
    - No regulatory path, weak data advantage, or unclear enterprise model
    - Long‑cycle research with no buyer urgency or production path
